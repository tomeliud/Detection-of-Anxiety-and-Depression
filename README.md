## Detection of Anxiety and Depression

A Flutter project.

## Getting Started

I used Google's <a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/">Teachable Machine</a> to train the model.
The model was saved as Tflite(TensorFlow Lite).
The model was then deployed using Flask Server and CSS & HTML for the frontend on the web. The android application runs on Flutter.
